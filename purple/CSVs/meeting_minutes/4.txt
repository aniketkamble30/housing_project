When you are writing meeting minutes you need to include different kinds of information. You should include the reason for the meeting, what it was about and where and when it was held. It is important to include a list of the attendees – both their first and last names. If you are not sure, you need to ask to make sure that you get the names right, otherwise your meeting minutes may be a source of irritation for attendees. If someone did not attend but it was important that they did, this should be included. For example, sometimes decisions cannot be made without a particular person being present.
In some instances, meeting minutes may be required for legal reasons. An example of this is where local bylaws require it for certain types of organizations. Also, they may be required for disciplinary meetings with employees. Getting into the habit of taking meeting minutes is good practice.
Writing minutes can take time, and may seem like an unimportant task compared with getting on with “real work”, but in fact not taking meeting minutes can be costly in terms of both time and resources.
